      <description>Code: github
A few days ago, a friend challenged me with this innocuous snake-looking puzzle cube:
The rules are simple, rotate the cubes however you like to form a 3x3x3 cube.
After banging my head on this for a few hours, I decided to put the damn thing to rest by solving it using a computer program.
My approach was to basically brute force the puzzle by trying one rotation after another while providing certain constraints.</description>

      <description>Still using Hugo to generate my sites and the same-old hand-rolled CSS.
I am using the XMin theme by Yihui Xie with my own CSS customizations.
This site also supports LaTeX via MathJax
$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$
Syntax higlighting via highlight.js - neat, woohoo, yay! /s
def hello_world(): print(&amp;quot;this is neat&amp;quot;)  Another feature: if you have an image, it automatically gets centered, like the Github Octocat below:</description>
