      <description>Many schools are located in small towns. Not everyone on campus has a car. Many such schools implement a shuttle, or jitney service - basically a car service that takes you wherever you like.
At my college, Colby College, if you want to request a ride or a pickup, the current modus operandi is to call the jitney driver or the security department which oversees the jitney service. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this such an annoying way to request a ride?</description>
