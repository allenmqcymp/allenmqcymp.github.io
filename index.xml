      <description>Still using Hugo to generate my sites and the same-old hand-rolled CSS. Hopefully, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting more about my excursions in machine-learning over January.
This site also supports LaTeX via MathJax
$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$
Syntax higlighting via highlight.js - neat, woohoo, yay! /s

      <description>I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Math at Colby College.
I am from New Zealand, and though I&amp;rsquo;ve been told many times that my country is the most beautiful place on Earth, I think every place has its own unique charm. Living and studying in Maine, I&amp;rsquo;ve explored a few very interesting landscapes, and look forward to exploring many more.
I enjoy programming, woodworking, grasping new ideas (whatever field they may be in) and solving math problems - especially when they are not too tricky and have an elegant solution.</description>
