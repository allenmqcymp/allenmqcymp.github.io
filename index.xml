      <description>A few days ago, a friend challenged me with this innocuous snake-looking puzzle cube:
The rules are simple, rotate the cubes however you like to form a 3x3x3 cube.
After banging my head on this for a few hours, I decided to put the damn thing to rest by solving it using Python.
My approach was to basically brute force the puzzle by trying one rotation after another while providing certain constraints.</description>

      <description>Many schools are located in small towns. Not everyone on campus has a car. Many such schools implement a shuttle, or jitney service - basically a car service that takes you wherever you like.
At my college, Colby College, if you want to request a ride or a pickup, the current modus operandi is to call the jitney driver or the security department which oversees the jitney service. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this such an annoying way to request a ride?</description>

      <description>Still using Hugo to generate my sites and the same-old hand-rolled CSS.
This site also supports LaTeX via MathJax
$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$
Syntax higlighting via highlight.js - neat, woohoo, yay! /s
def hello_world(): print(&amp;quot;this is neat&amp;quot;)  Another feature: if you have an image, it automatically gets centered, like the Github Octocat below:</description>

      <description>I am currently studying Computer Science and Math at Colby College, expecting to graduate in 2021. However, I am also studying towards a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering at Dartmouth College, graduating in 2022.
Please note that completing my B.E in 2022 is optional, and that I am open to full-time offers after graduation in 2021.
A little bit about myself:
I am Chinese, although I&amp;rsquo;ve lived most of my life in Auckland, New Zealand.</description>
